        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
        <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package lasagna sheets</li>
            <li>1 kg ground beef</li>
            <li>750 g tomato sauce</li>
            <li>250g tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>some italian seasoning</li>
            <li>250g shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>1 pack of bechamel sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook pasta sheets to package instructions and drain them when cooked</li>
            <li>Cook ground beef in a large pan. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, garlic and the seasoning. Let it simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take an oven-safe dish to stack lasagna in and preheat the oven to 190 degree Celsius.</li>
            <li>Start layering lasagne. Start with a thin layer of sauce, followed by a layer of pasta, bechamel and cheese. Repeat the process until the dish is filled.</li>
            <li>Top the lasagna with more mozzarella and bake it for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your delicious lasagna!</li>
